 * Icons adapted from https://phosphoricons.com/
 *
 * Want to add more?
 * 1. Find the icon you want on Phosphor Icons.
 * 2. Click “Copy SVG”.
 * 3. Paste the SVG code in your editor.
 * 4. Remove the `<svg>` wrapper so you only have elements like `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>` etc.
 * 5. Remove any `stroke="#000000"` attributes
 * 6. Replace any `fill="#000000"` attributes with `stroke="none"`
 *    (or add `stroke="none"` on shapes with no `fill` or `stroke` specified).
